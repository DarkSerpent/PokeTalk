I'm...not sure about the legality of hosting licensed fonts on Github, so...

• If you need this repo for debug-related reasons, you might be able to find something in the example files I left for debugging purposes! *wink*
• The other fonts (Dyno-Bold, Dyno-Regular, and FutureMillenium) are freeware, so I can supply them just fine!
• Otherwise, this is the one font file you'll need and the links to where you can purchase them:
