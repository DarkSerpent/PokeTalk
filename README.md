# PokeTalk
A hastily-designed example of what a "contemporary" Pok√©Nav could look like in HTML for use in PTU

# What is the purpose of this?
Primarily designed for my own living server with 1 GM and several players, where it was nearly impossible to keep track of which player owned the contact information for which NPC. In addition, whenever a long break (by either the player or GM) would occur, it was sometimes extremely hard to remember those few NPCs that we only met once!

In short, this is an over-designed, yet simultaneously lacking interpertation of an idea. Think of this as a shoddy prototype with a lot of paint and aesthetic flare!

The "example" folder is the exact code that I use for my own home game (as of 4-13-2023, which is the last time I've updated it). The raw files contained outside the example folder is a skeleton that you can repurporse like jangled markup madlibs.

# Instructions
A lot of this is lifted from the README.txt files included in the zip file:
* Edit poketalk_reference.html to make changes to the site! Publish a link to poketalk.html for the phone-screen overlay!
* The search function doesn't work. This is intentional.
* ...Not really, I just couldn't be bothered to set it up.
* I'm sorry.
* Read the comments contained in the files for everything else!
