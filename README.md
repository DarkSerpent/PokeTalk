# PokéTalk
A framework for a "contemporary" PokéNav made in HTML for use in PTU (or any Pokémon-based roleplaying/tabletop server, really).

## What is the purpose of this?
Primarily designed for my own living server with 1 GM and several players, where it was nearly impossible to keep track of which player owned the contact information for which NPC. In addition, whenever a long break (by either the player or GM) would occur, it was sometimes extremely hard to remember those few NPCs that we only met once!

## Instructions
A lot of this is lifted from the README.txt files included in the zip file:
* Edit poketalk_reference.html to make changes to the site! Publish a link to poketalk.html for the phone-screen overlay!
* You're done!

## Credits
* tooltip code taken from w3schools
* scrollbar code taken from digitalocean
